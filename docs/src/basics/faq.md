## Performance

#### Do you support GPUs? Multithreading? Distributed computation?

Yes. The `*`DiffEq.jl libraries (OrdinaryDiffEq.jl, StochasticDiffEq.jl, and
DelayDiffEq.jl) are all written to be generic to the array and number types.
This means they will adopt the implementation that is given by the array type.
The in-place algorithms internally utilize Julia's broadcast (with some exceptions
due to a Julia bug for now, see [this issue](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl/issues/106))
and Julia's `A_mul_B!` in-place matrix multiplication function. The out-of-place
algorithms utilize standard arithmetical functions. Both additionally utilize
the user's norm specified via the common interface options and, if a stiff
solver, ForwardDiff/DiffEqDiffTools for the Jacobian calculation, and Base linear
factorizations for the linear solve. For your type, you may likely need to give
a [better form of the norm](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/basics/common_solver_opts.html#Advanced-Adaptive-Stepsize-Control-1),
[Jacobian](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/features/performance_overloads.html),
or [linear solve calculations](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/features/linear_nonlinear.html)
to fully utilize parallelism.

GPUArrays.jl, ArrayFire.jl, DistributedArrays.jl have been tested and work in
various forms, where the last one is still not recommended for common use
yet.

The next question is whether it matters. Generally, your system has to be large
for parallelism to matter. Using a multithreaded array for broadcast we find
helpful around `N>1000`, though the Sundials manual says `N>100,000`. For high
order Runge-Kutta methods it's likely lower than the Sundials estimate because
of more operations packed into each internal step, but as always that will need
more benchmarks to be precise and will depend on the problem being solved. GPUs
generally require some intensive parallel operation in the user's `f` function
to be viable, for example a matrix multiplication for a stencil computation
in a PDE. If you're simply solving some ODE element-wise on a big array it likely
won't do much or it will slow things down just due to how GPUs work.
DistributedArrays require parallel linear solves to really matter, and thus are
only recommended when you have a problem that cannot fit into memory or are using
a stiff solver with a Krylov method for the linear solves.

#### My ODE is solving really slow... what do I do?

First, check for bugs. These solvers go through a ton of convergence tests and
so if there's a solver issue, it's either just something to do with how numerical
methods work or it's a user-error (generally the latter, though check the later
part of the FAQ on normal numerical errors). User-errors in the `f` function
causing a divergence of the solution is the most common reason for reported
slow codes.

If you have no bugs, great! The standard tricks for optimizing Julia code then
apply. What you want to do first is make sure your function does not allocate.
If your system is small (`<=100` ODEs/SDEs/DDEs/DAEs?), then you should set your
system up to use [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl).
This is demonstrated
[in the ODE tutorial](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/ode_example.html#Example-3:-Using-Other-Types-for-Systems-of-Equations-1)
with static matrices. Static vectors/arrays are stack-allocated, and thus creating
new arrays is free and the compiler doesn't have to heap-allocate any of the
temporaries (that's the expensive part!). These have specialized super fast
dispatches for arithmetic operations and extra things like QR-factorizations,
and thus they are preferred when possible. However, they lose efficiency if they
grow too large.

For anything larger, you should use the `in-place` syntax `f(du,u,p,t)` and make
sure that your function doesn't allocate. Assuming you know of a `u0`, you
should be able to do:

```julia
du = similar(u0)
@time f(du,u0,p,t)
```

and see close to zero allocations and close to zero memory allocated. If you see
more, then you might have a type-instability or have temporary arrays. To find
type-instabilities, you should do:

```julia
@code_warntype f(du,u,p,t)
```

and read the printout to see if there's any types that aren't inferred by the
compiler, and fix them. If you have any global variables, you should make them
`const`. As for allocations, some common things that allocate
are:

- Array slicing, like `u[1:5]`. Instead, use `@view u[1:5]`
- Matrix multiplication with `*`. Instead of `A*b`, use `A_mul_B!(c,A,b)` for some
  pre-allocated cache vector `c`.
- Non-broadcasted expressions. Every expression on arrays should `.=` into another
  array, or it should be re-written to loop and do computations with scalar (or
  static array) values.

For an example of optimizing a function resulting from a PDE discretization, see
[this blog post](http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/solving-systems-stochastic-pdes-using-gpus-julia/).

#### The stiff solver takes forever to take steps for my PDE discretization! Why?

The solvers for stiff solvers require solving a nonlinear equation each step.
In order to do so, they have to do a few Newton steps. By default, these methods
assume that the Jacobian is dense, automatically calculate the Jacobian for you,
and do a dense factorization. However, in many cases you may want to use alternatives
that are more tuned for your problem.

First of all, when available, it's recommended that you pass a function for computing
your Jacobian. This is discussed in the [performance overloads](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/features/performance_overloads.html#Declaring-Explicit-Jacobians-1)
section. Jacobians are especially helpful for Rosenbrock methods.

Secondly, if your Jacobian isn't dense, you shouldn't use a dense Jacobian! In
the Sundials algorithm you can set `linear_solver=:Band` for banded Jacobians
for example. More support is coming for this soon.

But lastly, you shouldn't use a dense factorization for large sparse matrices.
Instead, if you're using  a `*DiffEq` library you should
[specify a linear solver](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/features/linear_nonlinear.html).
For Sundials.jl, you should change the `linear_solver` option. See
[the ODE solve Sundials portion](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/solvers/ode_solve.html#Sundials.jl-1)
for details on that. Right now, Sundials.jl is the recommended method for stiff
problems with large sparse Jacobians. `linear_solver=:Band` should be used
if your Jacobian is banded and you can specify the band sizes. If you only
know the Jacobian is sparse, `linear_solver=:GMRES` is a good option. Once
again, a good reference for how to handle PDE discretizations can be found
[at this blog post](http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/solving-systems-stochastic-pdes-using-gpus-julia/).

## Complicated Models

#### Can I switch my ODE function in the middle of integration?

There are a few ways to do this. The simplest way is to just have a parameter to
switch between the two. For example:

```julia
function f(du,u,p,t)
  if p == 0
    du[1] = 2u[1]
  else
    du[1] = -2u[1]
  end
  du[2] = -u[2]
end
```

Then in a callback you can make the `affect!` function modify `integrator.prob.p`.
For example, we can make it change when `u[2]<0.5` via:

```julia
condition(u,t,integrator) = u[2] - 0.5
affect!(integrator) = integrator.prob.p = 1
```

Then it will change betweeen the two ODE choices for `du1` at that moment.
Another way to do this is to make the ODE functions all be the same type
via FunctionWrappers.jl, but that is unnecessary. With the way that modern
processors work, there exists branch prediction and thus execution of a conditional
is free if it's predictable which branch will be taken. In this case, almost every
call to `f` takes the `p==0` route until the callback, at which point it is
almost always the `else` route. Therefore the processor will effectively get
rid of the computational cost associated with this, so you're likely over-optimizing
if you're going further (unless this change happens every step, but even then
this is probably the cheapest part of the computation...).

## Numerical Error

#### The solver doesn't obey physical law X (e.g. conservation of energy)

Yes, this is because the numerical solution of the ODE is not the exact solution.
There are a few ways that you can handle this problem. One way is to get a more
exact solution. Thus instead of

```julia
sol = solve(prob,alg)
```

use

```julia
sol = solve(prob,alg,abstol=1e-10,reltol=1e-10)
```

Of course, there's always a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, so play
around to find out what's right for your problem.

Another thing you can do is use a callback. There are some
[premade callbacks in the callback library](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/features/callback_library.html) which
handle these sorts of things like projecting to manifolds and preserving positivity.

##### The symplectic integrator doesn't conserve energy?

Yes, symplectic integrators do not exactly conserve energy. It is a common
misconception that they do. What symplectic integrators actually do is solve
for a trajectory which rests on a symplectic manifold that is perturbed from
the true solution's manifold by the truncation error. This means that symplectic
integrators do not experience (very much) long time drift, but their orbit is
not exactly the same as the true solution in phase space and thus you will
see differences in energy that tend to look periodic. There is a small drift
which grows linearly and is related to floating point error, but this drift
is much less than standard methods. This is why symplectic methods are recommended
for long time integration.

For conserving energy, there are a few things you can do. First of all, the energy
error is related to the integration error, so simply solving with higher accuracy
will reduce the error. The results in the
[DiffEqBenchmarks](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqBenchmarks.jl) show
that using a `DPRKN` method with low tolerance can be a great choice. Another
thing you can do is use
[the ManifoldProjection callback from the callback library](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/features/callback_library.html).

#### How do I get to zero error?

You can't. For floating point numbers, you shouldn't use below `abstol=1e-14`
and `reltol=1e-14`. If you need lower than that, use arbitrary precision numbers
like BigFloats or [ArbFloats.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArbTypes/ArbFloats.jl).

## Autodifferentiation and Dual Numbers

#### Are the native Julia solvers compatible with autodifferentiation?

Yes! However, you should first look into
[sensitivity analysis](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/analysis/sensitivity.html)
as a (possibly in the future) more efficient method for calculating derivatives
of the solution and functionals of the solution.

But if you still want to do it the naive way, here's how you do it.
If the algorithm does not use adaptive time stepping, then you simply
need to make the initial condition have elements of Dual numbers. If the
algorithm uses Dual numbers, you need to make sure that time is also
given by Dual numbers. A quick explanation of this is because changing
the value of the initial condition will change the error in the steps, thus
causing different steps to be taken changing the time values.

To show this in action, let's say we want to find the Jacobian of solution
of the Lotka-Volterra equation at `t=10` with respect to the parameters.

```julia
function func(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = p[1] * u[1] - p[2] * u[1]*u[2]
  du[2] = -3 * u[2] + u[1]*u[2]
end
function f(p)
  prob = ODEProblem(func,eltype(p).([1.0,1.0]),eltype(p).((0.0,10.0)),p)
  solve(prob,Tsit5(),save_everystep=false)[end]
end
```

This function takes in new parameters and spits out the solution at the end.
We make the inital condition `eltype(p).([1.0,1.0])` so that way it's typed to
be Dual numbers whenever `p` is an array of `Dual` numbers, and we do the same
for the timespan. Then we can take the Jacobian via ForwardDiff.jl:

```julia
using ForwardDiff
ForwardDiff.jacobian(f,[1.5,1.0])

2×2 Array{Float64,2}:
  2.20214   0.189782
 -6.2273   -0.700188
```

and compare it to Calculus.jl:

```julia
Calculus.jacobian(f,[1.5,1.0],:central)

2×2 Array{Float64,2}:
  2.20214   0.189782
 -6.2273   -0.700188
```

#### I get Dual number errors when I solve my ODE with Rosenbrock or SDIRK methods...?

This is because you're using a cache which is not compatible with autodifferentiaion
via ForwardDiff.jl. For example, if we use the ODE function:

```julia
const tmp = zeros(4)
const A = rand(4,4)
function f(du,u,p,t)
  A_mul_B!(tmp,A,u)
  du .= tmp .+ u
end
```

Here we use a cached temporary array in order to avoid the allocations of matrix
multiplication. When autodifferentiation occurs, the element type of `u` is
`Dual` numbers, so `A*u` produces `Dual` numbers, so the error arises when it
tries to write into `tmp`. There are two ways to avoid this. The first way,
the easy way, is to just turn off autodifferentiation with the `autodiff=false`
option in the solver. Every solver which uses autodifferentiation has this option.
Thus we'd solve this with:

```julia
prob = ODEProblem(f,rand(4),(0.0,1.0))
sol = solve(prob,Rosenbrock23(autodiff=false))
```

and it will use a numerical differentiation fallback (DiffEqDiffTools.jl) to
calculate Jacobians.

** Warning: Advanced **

The more difficult way is to create a Dual cache which dispatches for the cache
choice based on the element type of `u`. This is done by the following:

```julia
using ForwardDiff
struct MyTag end
immutable DiffCache{T<:AbstractArray, S<:AbstractArray}
    du::T
    dual_du::S
end

function DiffCache{chunk_size}(T, size, ::Type{Val{chunk_size}})
    DiffCache(zeros(T, size...), zeros(ForwardDiff.Dual{nothing,T,chunk_size}, size...))
end

DiffCache(u::AbstractArray) = DiffCache(eltype(u),size(u),Val{ForwardDiff.pickchunksize(length(u))})

get_tmp{T<:ForwardDiff.Dual}(dc::DiffCache, ::Type{T}) = dc.dual_du
get_tmp(dc::DiffCache, T) = dc.du
```

Now we can get a cache that by dispatch either gives a cache array of `Dual`
numbers or just floating point numbers:


```julia
const dual_cache = DiffCache(rand(4)) # Build the cache, this must match your IC
du = get_tmp(dual_cache,typeof(rand(4))) # Gives a Array{Float64}
dual_du = get_tmp(dual_cache,typeof(ForwardDiff.Dual(0.2,3.0))) # Gives Array{Dual}
```

Note that you have to make sure that your chunk size matches the choice in the
ODE solver (by default, it uses `ForwardDiff.pickchunksize(length(u))` as well,
so you only need to change this if you explicitly set `chunksize = ...`). Now
we can setup and solve our ODE using this cache:

```julia
function f(du,u,p,t)
  # Get du from cache
  tmp = get_tmp(dual_cache,eltype(u))
  # Fix tag
  _tmp = reinterpret(eltype(u),tmp)
  A_mul_B!(_tmp,A,u)
  du .= _tmp .+ u
end
prob = ODEProblem(f,rand(4),(0.0,1.0))
sol = solve(prob,Rosenbrock23())
```

Small explanation is in order. `tmp = get_tmp(dual_cache,eltype(u))` makes `tmp`
match `u` in terms of `Dual` or not, but it doesn't necessarily match the tag.
So now we `reinterpret` our `Dual` array to put the right tag on there. Note
that this simply changes type information and thus does not create any temporary
arrays. Once we do that, our cached array is now typed correctly to hold the
result of `A_mul_B!`.
